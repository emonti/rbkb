== 0.6.12 / 2009-10-15
  * better ruby 1.8 <-> 1.9 portability
  * tweaked rotate_bytes while dorking around with rotation lameness

== 0.6.11 / 2009-10-06
  * split off rbkb/http as its own package
  * added some new String crypto utilities in extends

== 0.6.10 / 2009-09-30
  * added -b/--blitsrv argument to plugsrv
  * added --target-tls/--server-tls arguments to plugsrv for TLS support

== 0.6.9.1 / 2009-09-08
  * fixed a typo in random_string()

== 0.6.9 / 2009-09-01
* Enhancements
  * telson and feed now support -s/--source address:port using TCP with 
    bind_connect via eventmachine
  * random_string and random_alphanum helper methods added 
* Bug-Fix
  * Plug's PeerList.find_peers was returning nil resulting in problems for 
    blit -l amongst other things.

== 0.6.8.1 / 2009-06-12
* Enhancements
  * Added String.rotate_bytes per request for a rotation cypher by 
    wardwouts@github. I pilfered this implementation mostly from Timur Duehr.

== 0.6.8 / 2009-06-04
* Enhancements
  * 0.6.8 is geared towards beginning to make rbkb compatible with ruby 1.9.x 
    (tested on 1.9.1). Had to sacrifice the 'uuid' helper method 
    since something happened to SHA1 in ruby 1.9. It may make a comeback if 
    anybody yells about this.
* Known Issues:
  * There are problems with binary releases of eventmachine with 1.9.1 on win32
    this does not appear to be caused by rbkb, however we're keeping an eye on 
    it. For now, this is causing the plug tools to crash and test cases to 
    fail on 1.9.1 win32.

== 0.6.7
* Enhancements
  * Http::Parameters was given the same treatement as headers got in 0.6.6. 
    Technically params are supposed to be unique, but we try to stay flexible 
    in Rbkb. 
* Bug-fix:
  * Fixed a silly typing bug in Http::Parameters.set_param introduced
    around 0.6.6

== 0.6.6
* Bug-fix:
  * Http library improperly made headers unique by name. The library has
    been changed so that headers no longer tries to pretend to be a hash.

== 0.6.5.2 
* Enhancements
  * d64 and b64 now support the -f option for input files as rdoc indicates
    Thanks to Cory Scott for catching this doc error and for his patch.

== 0.6.5.1 
* Minor bug-fix
  * fixed a problem with the gem, version bump is for github visibility

== 0.6.5 / 2009-03-24

* Enhancements
  * Added a http protocol library (Rbkb::Http)
  * Added TLS support to telson (-S/--start-tls in cli)
  * Added raw dump output to telson (-d raw/hex in cli : hex is default)

== 0.6.4 / 2009-03-20

* Enhancements
  * Added unit tests for all cli utilities. Most are fairly complete.

== 0.6.3 / 2009-03-10

* Enhancements
  * Started using bones to help manage this mess. History.txt is born!
  * begun adding test cases for cli utils
  * crc32 takes an optional filename argument as first arg
